# Install Scripts

Some scripts that setup a new Arch installation, update packages, install some pre-defined commonly used apps, setup AUR access, etc.

***These scripts are tailored to my use-cases, they may not be suitable for yours.**

The AUR scripts in this folder should be ran in a particular order:
1. install-aur.sh
2. install-aur-apps.sh

The latter will fail if the former has not been ran first.
Other scripts can be done in any order.
