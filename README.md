# dotfiles

I got tired of distro-hopping and starting from scratch each time, so I've made some dotfiles and scripts to automate the tedious stuff.

This repo is currently specific to Arch-based linux distributions. I intend to modify it at a later date to support MacOS, and maybe Debian based distros. Don't hold your breath though ;)

The script files in this repo have been heavily inspired by [Lissy93/dotfiles](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles), so a lot of the credit goes to her!
