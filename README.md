# dotfiles

I got tired of distro-hopping and starting from scratch each time, so I've made some dotfiles and scripts to automate the tedious stuff.

This repo is currently specific to Arch-based linux distributions. I intend to modify it at a later date to support MacOS, and maybe Debian based distros. Don't hold your breath though ;)

The script files in this repo have been *heavily inspired* by [Lissy93/dotfiles](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles), credit goes to her awesome dotfiles!

## Contents
In addition to a custom zsh terminal shell config, this repo also contains configurations for the following tools:
- nvim (Most of which has come directly from [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), with some additional config overrides and plugins that I have added.)
- i3 (window manager, main things that I have changed is the navigation to match vim bindings, as well as moving the i3bar to the top, there is no ricing applied (yet)).
